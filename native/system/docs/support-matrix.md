The stable Node-API v8 addon is built once per platform/libc and exercised by CI under Node 20, 22, 24, and 26. macOS builds target 11.0 or later. Linux binding selection uses the running Node process's libc; the static launcher serves both libc variants. FreeBSD has one libc and only the POSIX flock addon; its package is compiled on the FreeBSD packaging host, so it is absent from the hosted CI matrices and marked as such in `scripts/github-matrix.mjs`.

Landlock additionally requires an enforcing Linux kernel. The functional probe determines full, partial, or unusable enforcement; kernel version alone is not an availability guarantee.

Windows has neither a Landlock launcher nor this POSIX addon. The Harness retains its existing Windows semaphore implementation. Other CPU/OS combinations have no published platform package: Landlock probes unusable, and flock acquisition rejects. New platform support requires a native builder and installed-artifact verification.
